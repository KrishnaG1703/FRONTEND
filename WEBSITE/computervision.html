        <h3>HAND TRACKING</h3>
        <p>I have developed a hand tracking project using Python, employing computer vision techniques and the Mediapipe library. This project enables real-time detection and tracking of hand movements and gestures through a webcam feed. By leveraging computer vision algorithms provided by Mediapipe, it accurately identifies key landmarks on the hand, facilitating various applications such as gesture recognition, virtual touch interfaces, and augmented reality interactions.
