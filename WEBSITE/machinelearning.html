                  <h3>Disease Prediction</h3>
                  <p>
                      The disease prediction code in Machine Learning utilizes algorithms to analyze medical data and predict the likelihood of a person having a particular disease. It involves preprocessing data to extract relevant features and then training a model using supervised learning techniques. The trained model can then classify new data instances into different disease categories based on their features. The code aims to assist in early disease detection and diagnosis by providing insights into potential health risks. It employs statistical methods and pattern recognition to identify underlying patterns in the data that may indicate disease presence. Ultimately, the disease prediction code serves as a tool to aid healthcare professionals in making informed decisions and providing timely interventions for patients.

              <h3>Fraud Detection</h3>
              <p>
                  The fraud prediction code utilizes random forests, a powerful machine learning algorithm, to analyze a dataset named "fraud.csv" for fraudulent activities. This dataset likely contains various features and labels indicating fraudulent and non-fraudulent transactions. The code employs random forests, a type of ensemble learning method, to build multiple decision trees and aggregate their predictions to enhance accuracy. By training on historical data, the model learns patterns and characteristics associated with fraudulent behavior. During prediction, it assesses new transactions and assigns probabilities of fraudulence based on learned patterns. Through iterative training and testing, the model continually improves its predictive capabilities, aiding in the detection and prevention of fraudulent activities.
